- npm or yarn (for managing JavaScript packages)

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/portfolio-app.git
cd portfolio-app
```

### 2. Set up a Python virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```

### 3. Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:
  ```bash
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- On macOS/Linux:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### 4. Install Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Set up the frontend (if applicable):

If your project includes a frontend with npm or yarn, install the necessary JavaScript dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# OR
yarn install
```

### 6. Run the migrations:

To set up the database, run the migrations:

python manage.py migrate
```

### 7. Create a superuser (optional):

To create an admin user for accessing the Django admin panel:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### 8. Run the development server:

Start the development server to test the application locally:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can:
